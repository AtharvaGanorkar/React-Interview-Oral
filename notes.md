<!-- Ouestion 1 : Difference between Element and Component -->

Definition
Element: A React Element is a plain JavaScript object that describes what you want to appear on the screen. It is immutable and represents a DOM node or another component. Elements are the smallest building blocks in React.

Component: A React Component is a function or class that returns JSX (or React elements). It allows you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces and manage their logic, state, and behavior.

Example
React Element (Without JSX):

const element = React.createElement("div", { id: "login-btn" }, "Login");

Equivalent JSX:

<div id="login-btn">Login</div>
What React.createElement() returns:

{
  type: 'div',
  props: {
    id: 'login-btn',
    children: 'Login'
  }
}
React Component (Functional):

jsx
Copy
Edit
const Button = ({ handleLogin }) => (
  <div id="login-btn" onClick={handleLogin}>
    Login
  </div>
);

JS equivalent of above JSX:

const Button = ({ handleLogin }) =>
  React.createElement(
    "div",
    { id: "login-btn", onClick: handleLogin },
    "Login"
  );

How to Tell in an Interview
"In React, an element is a plain JavaScript object that describes a DOM node or another component. It’s immutable and created using React.createElement() or JSX. A component, on the other hand, is a function or class that returns JSX. Components are reusable, can handle state, and represent a piece of UI logic. While elements are what React uses to build the virtual DOM, components are how we structure and organize the UI."
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 2 :How to Create Components -->

Definition
Components are the core building blocks of a React application. They let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces. React offers two main ways to define components:

Function Components: These are simple JavaScript functions that receive props and return JSX. They are the most commonly used method, especially with Hooks.

Class Components: These are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and must include a render() method. They were widely used before Hooks were introduced.

Example
Function Component:

function Greeting({ message }) {
  return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>;
}
Class Component:

class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>;
  }
}
Both will render:

<h1>Hello, [message]</h1>

How to Tell in an Interview
"In React, we can create components either as function components or class components. Function components are preferred today because they're simpler and support Hooks for state and lifecycle features. They accept props as input and return JSX. Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and include a render() method. Although still valid, class components are now less commonly used in new codebases."


<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 3:  What is State? -->

Definition
State in React is a built-in object used to store dynamic data in a component. It determines how that component behaves and what it renders. Unlike props, which are passed down from parent to child, state is local and controlled within the component. When the state changes, React automatically re-renders the component to reflect the new values.

import { useState } from "react";

function User() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("Welcome to React world");

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{message}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
useState("Welcome to React world") initializes state.

message is the current state value.

setMessage is the function used to update the state.

When setMessage is called, the component re-renders with the updated state.

How to Tell in an Interview
"In React, state is a built-in object used to manage data that can change over the lifetime of a component. It's local to the component and can be initialized using the useState Hook in function components. Whenever the state changes, React re-renders the component with the new state. This is how React maintains interactivity and ensures the UI stays in sync with user actions or application logic."

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 4: What is Virtual DOM? -->


Definition
The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the real DOM in the browser. Instead of directly manipulating the browser's DOM (which is slow), React creates a virtual copy of the DOM in memory. When the state of a component changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first, compares it with the previous version (using a process called diffing), and then efficiently updates only the parts of the real DOM that changed.

Example
Let's say a component renders a list of items:

function ItemList({ items }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map(item => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}
Initially, the Virtual DOM contains a tree structure representing this list.

If one item changes, React:

Updates the Virtual DOM.

Compares it with the old Virtual DOM.

Updates only that changed <li> in the real DOM instead of re-rendering the whole <ul>.

How to Tell in an Interview
"The Virtual DOM is a concept used by React to optimize performance. Instead of manipulating the real DOM directly, React keeps a virtual copy of the UI in memory. When changes occur, React performs a diffing algorithm to compare the new Virtual DOM with the previous one, and then applies only the minimal required changes to the actual DOM. This process makes updates faster and more efficient, leading to better performance in complex applications."

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!-- Question 5: What are Stateful Components?-->
Definition
A stateful component in React is a component whose behavior and rendered output depend on its internal state. These components manage their own data using React's useState Hook (for function components) or this.state (in class components). The state allows the component to respond to user input, server responses, or other changes dynamically.

Example

import React, { useState } from 'react';

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleIncrement = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
      <span>Counter: {count}</span>
    </>
  );
};
useState(0) initializes the count state to 0.

handleIncrement updates the state on button click.

Since the component depends on and updates state, it is stateful.

How to Tell in an Interview
"A stateful component is one that maintains its own state using either the useState hook in function components or this.state in class components. These components re-render automatically whenever their state changes. They’re useful when you need to track data that updates over time—like form inputs, counters, or toggle buttons. In contrast, stateless components simply receive data via props and don’t manage internal state." 

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 6: How to Loop Inside JSX -->
Definition
In JSX, you cannot use traditional control statements like for loops directly inside the return block because JSX is syntactic sugar for function calls and expressions, not statements. Instead, the most common and recommended way to loop in JSX is by using JavaScript’s Array.prototype.map() method, which works perfectly inside JSX expressions.

Example
✅ Correct way using map():

<tbody>
  {items.map((item) => (
    <SomeComponent key={item.id} name={item.name} />
  ))}
</tbody>

❌ Incorrect way using for loop (will cause an error):
<tbody>
  for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    <SomeComponent key={items[i].id} name={items[i].name} />
  }
</tbody>

The map() method is used because it returns an array of elements, which is exactly what JSX expects inside expressions.

You must use a unique key prop when rendering lists in React for optimal rendering performance and correct DOM diffing.

How to Tell in an Interview
"In JSX, we use the map() method to loop over arrays because JSX expects expressions, not statements like for loops. map() lets us transform an array of data into an array of elements that can be rendered. For example, when rendering a list of components, we pass each item to map() and return a JSX element with a unique key prop. Using traditional loops like for directly inside JSX will result in a syntax error because JSX doesn't support statement blocks." 

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<!-- Question 7 :Difference between React and ReactDOM  -->

Definition

React: The react package provides the core functionalities of the React library. It includes functions and classes like React.createElement(), React.Component, useState, and useEffect, which are used to build and manage components and elements. It's platform-agnostic, meaning it doesn’t assume anything about the environment (browser, server, native).

ReactDOM: The react-dom package is specific to web browsers. It provides methods to interact with the DOM, like ReactDOM.render() for rendering components to the browser, and ReactDOM.hydrate() for hydration in SSR (server-side rendering). It acts as a bridge between React and the actual DOM.

Example
// react
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// react-dom
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

// Create a simple component
function App() {
  const [message] = useState("Hello React");
  return <h1>{message}</h1>;
}

// Render to the DOM
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);
useState comes from react

ReactDOM.createRoot and render come from react-dom

How to Tell in an Interview
"React provides the core APIs like createElement, Hooks, and component classes that we use to build components, but it doesn’t deal with the DOM directly. ReactDOM, on the other hand, provides the methods needed to render those components into the actual DOM in web browsers, such as ReactDOM.render() or ReactDOM.createRoot(). So React is about building components, and ReactDOM is about mounting them to the browser."

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 8:What is React Router? -->

Definition

React Router is a standard routing library for React applications. It enables navigation between different views or pages in a single-page application (SPA) without reloading the entire page. React Router uses dynamic routing, meaning the routing is handled as part of the component rendering, allowing seamless navigation and deep linking within the app.

It provides components like <BrowserRouter>, <Routes>, <Route>, <Link>, and hooks like useNavigate, useParams, and useLocation to control navigation and access route-related data.

Example

import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';

function Home() {
  return <h2>Home Page</h2>;
}

function About() {
  return <h2>About Page</h2>;
}

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}
<BrowserRouter> wraps the app to enable routing.

<Route> defines the path-to-component mapping.

<Link> is used for navigation without full page reloads.

How to Tell in an Interview
"React Router is a popular library used for implementing routing in React single-page applications. It allows developers to map URLs to specific components and handle client-side navigation without reloading the page. It uses dynamic routing and provides various tools like <BrowserRouter>, <Route>, <Link>, and hooks like useNavigate for navigation and route management. This makes React apps feel fast and seamless, just like a native application."

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<!-- Question 9 :: What is Redux? -->

Definition
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It provides a single centralized store to hold the entire application state and allows predictable state updates through pure functions called reducers. Redux follows a unidirectional data flow pattern: components dispatch actions, reducers process those actions, and the store updates the state accordingly.

Redux is useful in large-scale applications where managing state across many components becomes complex.

Example
A simple Redux flow:

// Action
const increment = () => ({ type: 'INCREMENT' });

// Reducer
const counterReducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT': return state + 1;
    default: return state;
  }
};

// Store
import { createStore } from 'redux';
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// Dispatch
store.dispatch(increment());
console.log(store.getState()); // Output: 1


<!-- In a React app, we use react-redux for integration: -->

import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';

function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector(state => state);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' })}>Increment</button>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </>
  );
}

How to Tell in an Interview
"Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, often used with React for centralized state management. It helps manage state in large applications by storing the entire state in a single store. State changes in Redux are handled via pure functions called reducers, which respond to actions dispatched by components. Redux follows a unidirectional data flow, making the app's state more predictable and easier to debug." 

<!-- =---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 10:Difference between React Context and Redux -->

Definition
Both React Context and Redux are tools for managing state in React applications, but they serve different use cases and operate differently:

React Context is a built-in feature used to pass data deeply through the component tree without prop drilling. It’s ideal for simple or global data (like themes, user auth, locale).

Redux is a third-party library that provides a centralized store and a strict architecture for state management using actions, reducers, and middleware. It’s suited for complex, large-scale applications.

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 11: What are Hooks  -->

Hooks are special functions introduced in React 16.8 that let you use state and other React features in functional components, which previously were only available in class components. Hooks allow you to manage state, handle side effects, access context, and more — all without writing a class.

Commonly used built-in Hooks:

useState() – for state management

useEffect() – for handling side effects (like data fetching or subscriptions)

useContext() – to consume context

useRef(), useReducer(), useMemo(), and others for advanced needs

Example

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count]); // Runs only when `count` changes

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </>
  );
}
u
<!-- seState(0) initializes state. -->

<!-- useEffect() updates the page title whenever count changes. -->

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

<!-- Question 12: Difference Between Real DOM and Virtual DOM  -->

Definition
Real DOM (Document Object Model) is the actual structure of the web page rendered by the browser. When changes are made, the entire DOM may need to be updated and re-rendered, which is slow and resource-intensive.

Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM used by React. When the UI changes, React updates the Virtual DOM first, compares it with the previous version (diffing), and applies only the necessary updates to the real DOM. This makes updates faster and more efficient.

Example

Feature          	Real DOM	                Virtual DOM
Update Speed	      Slow	                      Fast
DOM Manipulation	Expensive	                  Optimized & Efficient
Direct HTML Update	Yes	                          No (via React rendering only)
Memory Usage	    High (with many updates)	  Minimal
Update Strategy	    Re-renders entire DOM tree	   Diffs and patches only changes

Real DOM Example:

document.getElementById('root').innerHTML = '<h1>Hello</h1>';

Virtual DOM (React) Example:

ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello</h1>, document.getElementById('root'));

How to Tell in an Interview
"The Real DOM is the browser's actual document structure. Every time a change is made, the entire DOM may be re-rendered, which can be slow. In contrast, Virtual DOM is a concept used by React to improve performance. React creates a virtual copy of the DOM in memory, updates it when state or props change, and then efficiently applies only the differences to the real DOM using a process called reconciliation. This makes UI updates faster and more efficient, especially in large applications."


<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 13: How to Fetch Data with React Hooks -->

Definition
To fetch data in React using hooks, we use the useEffect hook for executing side effects (like data fetching), and the useState hook to store and manage the fetched data. The useEffect hook allows you to run asynchronous code when the component mounts or updates. When an empty dependency array [] is passed, the effect runs only once — similar to componentDidMount() in class components.

Example
✅ Using fetch() API:

import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState({ hits: [] });

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=react")
      .then((response) => response.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array: runs once on mount

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.hits.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.objectID}>
          <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default App;

✅ Using Axios (alternative):

<!-- npm install axios -->


import axios from "axios";
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get("https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=react")
      .then((res) => setData(res.data.hits));
  }, []);

  return (
    <ul>
      {data.map((item) => (
        <li key={item.objectID}>
          <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

How to Tell in an Interview
"We use useEffect to fetch data in functional React components. It runs after the component renders, and when we pass an empty array as its second argument, it behaves like componentDidMount, meaning it only runs once on initial render. We typically fetch data using fetch() or libraries like Axios, and store the result using useState. This keeps data fetching and component logic clean and React-idiomatic."

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 14:  Difference Between useState and useRef Hook -->

Definition
useState is a React Hook used to create and manage stateful values in a component. When the state changes, React re-renders the component.

useRef is a React Hook used to create a mutable reference that persists across renders without causing a re-render when its value changes. It’s commonly used to reference DOM elements or store values like previous state, timers, or external library instances.

Example

✅ useState Example (causes re-render):

import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <p>{count}</p>
    </>
  );
}

✅ useRef Example (no re-render):

import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function Timer() {
  const timerId = useRef(null);

  const startTimer = () => {
    timerId.current = setInterval(() => {
      console.log("Timer running...");
    }, 1000);
  };

  return <button onClick={startTimer}>Start Timer</button>;
}

How to Tell in an Interview
"useState is used when I want a value that, when updated, should trigger a re-render of the component. For example, tracking user input or counters. On the other hand, useRef holds a mutable value that persists across renders but doesn’t cause the component to re-render when updated. I typically use useRef for DOM manipulation, storing timer IDs, or keeping track of previous values."

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 15: useReducer Hook  -->

Definition
useReducer is a React hook that is used for managing complex state logic in functional components. It is an alternative to useState when you need to handle state that depends on previous state values or when the logic of state transitions is more complex.

useReducer is often preferred when:

The state is an object or array.

The state changes are based on previous state values.

You want to centralize state update logic and separate it from the component rendering.

Syntax
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
reducer: A function that defines how the state should change based on the action.

initialState: The initial state value.

state: The current state, which is updated based on dispatched actions.

dispatch: A function that you call to send actions to the reducer function.

Example Usage
Let’s say we want to manage the state of a counter, which can be incremented, decremented, and reset.

import React, { useReducer } from "react";

// Reducer function that defines how state changes based on actions
function counterReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    case "reset":
      return { count: 0 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  // Initial state is an object with a count property
  const initialState = { count: 0 };

  // useReducer hook to manage state and dispatch actions
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, initialState);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Count: {state.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>Decrement</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "reset" })}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
counterReducer: A function that accepts the current state and an action and returns a new state.

dispatch: Triggers a state change by passing an action with a type (e.g., "increment", "decrement", "reset").


How to Tell in an Interview
"The useReducer hook is useful when managing complex state logic in React. It provides a central place for handling all state updates through a reducer function. The hook takes a reducer function and an initial state and returns the current state and a dispatch function. Each action that gets dispatched to the reducer results in a state transition, making it ideal for scenarios where multiple state variables depend on each other or when complex state logic is required."

<!-- ---------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 16 : useState vs useReducer -->

Definition
useState: A basic React hook for managing state in functional components. It is ideal for managing simple state values like numbers, strings, booleans, etc., that do not depend on each other or have complex logic.

useReducer: A more advanced hook used when the state logic is more complex, especially when the state depends on the previous state or when there are multiple state transitions. It is based on the concept of reducers (similar to Redux) and is generally used when the state management involves multiple actions or state updates.

<!-- When to Use useState -->
Simple state updates (e.g., counters, toggles).

When you don't need to manage state that depends on previous state values.

Ideal for smaller, less complex components.

<!-- When to Use useReducer -->
Complex state transitions (e.g., updating an object or array with multiple fields).

When state updates depend on the previous state value.

Managing multiple state variables that need to be updated based on the same action.

When you want to centralize your state management logic for clarity and maintainability.



<!-- useState Example (Counter): -->

import { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
  const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{count}</h1>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={decrement}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

<!-- useReducer Example (Counter with Multiple Actions):// -->
import { useReducer } from "react";

function counterReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case "decrement":
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{state.count}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "increment" })}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: "decrement" })}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
}

<!-- How to Tell in an Interview -->
useState: "I use useState for simple state management needs, such as counters, toggles, or input values, where the state doesn’t depend on complex logic or multiple actions."

useReducer: "When managing more complex states or multiple related state transitions, I prefer useReducer. It gives me a structured way to handle state updates through actions, especially when dealing with objects or arrays."

<!-- Question 17:React: Context API with useContext Hook -->

Definition
Context in React is a way to share values like global state or settings between components without passing props manually at every level of the component tree.

useContext is a hook that allows you to access the value of a context directly in a functional component, without needing to use a Context.Consumer.

How It Works
The useContext hook is used in conjunction with the Context Provider. You create a context using React.createContext() and use a Context.Provider to pass the context value down the component tree. Then, any child component that needs access to the context value can use the useContext hook to consume the value.

<!-- Steps to Use useContext -->
<!-- Create a Context: -->
You create a context using React.createContext(). This returns an object with two components: Provider and Consumer. Provider allows you to pass down the context value, while useContext allows you to consume it.

const MyContext = React.createContext();

Wrap Components with Context.Provider:
The Provider component is used to provide a value to the context. Any child component wrapped inside this provider can access the context value.

<MyContext.Provider value={{ name: "John", age: 30 }}>
  <ChildComponent />
</MyContext.Provider>

Consume the Context Value with useContext:
The useContext hook is used inside functional components to access the context value directly.

import { useContext } from "react";

function ChildComponent() {
  const contextValue = useContext(MyContext);
  return (
    <div>
      Name: {contextValue.name}, Age: {contextValue.age}
    </div>
  );
}
<!-- Example of Using Context with useContext -->
Here’s an example demonstrating how to use useContext to share a user profile across different components:

Create Context:

import React, { createContext, useContext } from "react";

const UserContext = createContext();
\
<!-- Wrap Application with Provider: -->

function App() {
  const user = { name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com" };

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <Profile />
      <Dashboard />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

<!-- Consume Context Using useContext: -->


function Profile() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);
  return <div>Profile: {user.name}</div>;
}

function Dashboard() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);
  return <div>Dashboard: {user.email}</div>;
}

In this example, both the Profile and Dashboard components consume the user data from UserContext.

When to Use useContext
Global state management: When you need to pass data deeply through the component tree without prop drilling.

Theming: Passing the theme information (dark/light) down to many components.

User authentication: Storing the authenticated user data and providing it across the app.

Language preferences: Sharing the current language preference across components.

<!-- Benefits of Using useContext -->
Simplifies prop drilling: You can avoid passing props down through multiple levels of components.

Encapsulates shared data: It allows you to easily manage and share state or configuration globally.

Makes components more reusable: Components can be decoupled from their direct parent-child relationships and depend on the context instead.

<!-- How to Tell in an Interview -->
"I use the useContext hook when I need to share state or data across multiple components that are deeply nested in the component tree. It helps avoid prop drilling by allowing components to consume the context directly. For example, I might use it for managing global settings, user authentication, or theming."

<!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 18:React: Context -->

Definition
Context in React provides a way to share values (like data or functions) across the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level. It is especially useful for global data that many components might need access to — such as the current authenticated user, theme settings, or language preference.

React Context helps avoid "prop drilling", where props are passed through intermediate components that do not need them just to reach deeply nested components.

Example
Creating a Context:

import React from 'react';

const MyContext = React.createContext("defaultValue");
This creates a context with a default value. React.createContext() returns an object with two components:

MyContext.Provider: Used to provide the value to children.

MyContext.Consumer: Used to consume the context value (not needed if you use useContext hook).

Providing the Context Value:

<MyContext.Provider value="Hello from context!">
  <Child />
</MyContext.Provider>
Consuming the Context (two ways):

<!-- Using useContext Hook (preferred in functional components): -->
import { useContext } from "react";

function Child() {
  const value = useContext(MyContext);
  return <p>{value}</p>;
}

<!-- Using Consumer Component (older approach): -->

<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => <p>{value}</p>}
</MyContext.Consumer>

<!-- How to Tell in an Interview -->
"React Context is used to avoid prop drilling by allowing you to share data like user info, themes, or locale across deeply nested components. I typically create a context using React.createContext(), wrap my app or specific component tree with a Provider, and consume the data using the useContext hook. This makes my components more clean and maintainable, especially for global application state."

<!-- Question 19: Difference between UseEffect and UseCallback Hook? -->

✅ What is useEffect?
📘 Definition:
useEffect is a React Hook that lets you perform side effects in functional components. Side effects include tasks like:

Fetching data from an API

Manipulating the DOM

Setting up a subscription

Starting and clearing timers

⚙️ How It Works:
It runs after the component renders.

You can specify dependencies so that the effect only runs when certain values change.

📌 Syntax:


useEffect(() => {
  // side effect code here
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
If the dependency array is:

[]: Runs only once after the first render (componentDidMount).
[someVar]: Runs after the first render and whenever someVar changes.
No array: Runs after every render.

✅ Example: Fetch data on mount

import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function UserList() {
  const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => setUsers(data));
  }, []); // Empty dependency array = run once on mount

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user) => (
        <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}


✅ What is useCallback?
📘 Definition:
useCallback is a React Hook that returns a memoized version of a callback function. It helps avoid re-creating the function unless its dependencies change.

It is useful when passing functions as props to child components — to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

⚙️ How It Works:
It remembers (memoizes) a function unless the dependencies change.

📌 Syntax:

const memoizedFunction = useCallback(() => {
  // logic
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);

✅ Example: Prevent unnecessary re-renders

import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

const Button = React.memo(({ onClick, label }) => {
  console.log(`Rendering button - ${label}`);
  return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>;
});

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [text, setText] = useState("");

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <Button onClick={increment} label="Increment" />
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

Without useCallback, the increment function would be recreated on every render, causing the Button component to re-render even when it didn’t need to.

🗣️ How to Answer in an Interview:
"useEffect is a hook used to perform side effects in React like data fetching, DOM updates, or timers. It runs after the component renders and can re-run based on dependencies. On the other hand, useCallback is used to memoize functions so they don’t get recreated on every render. This is particularly useful when passing functions as props to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders."

<---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 20: diff between UseMemo and UseCallback   -->

React provides both useMemo and useCallback hooks for performance optimization by avoiding unnecessary re-renders and recalculations. While they are similar in how they accept dependencies, their purpose is different.

🧠 useMemo — Detailed Explanation
✅ Definition:
useMemo is a React Hook that returns a memoized value. It is used to avoid re-executing expensive calculations on every render unless its dependencies have changed.

📘 Syntax:

const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
computeExpensiveValue → a function that returns the result you want to cache.

[a, b] → dependency array: recompute only when a or b changes.



💡 Real-World Example (useMemo):

import React, { useMemo, useState } from 'react';

function ExpensiveComponent({ number }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const squaredNumber = useMemo(() => {
    console.log("Calculating square...");
    return number * number;
  }, [number]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Square: {squaredNumber}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Re-render Component</button>
    </div>
  );
}

🧪 Behavior:
On first render, it logs "Calculating square..." and computes.

When you click the button, the component re-renders, but the square is not recalculated because number hasn't changed.


⚙️ useCallback — Detailed Explanation
✅ Definition:
useCallback is a React Hook that returns a memoized version of a callback function, which helps prevent unnecessary re-creations of the function between renders.


📘 Syntax:
javascript
Copy
Edit
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);
The function inside is only recreated if dependencies (a, b) change.


💡 Real-World Example (useCallback):

import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function Child({ onClick }) {
  console.log("Child rendered");
  return <button onClick={onClick}>Click Me</button>;
}

function Parent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = useCallback(() => {
    setCount((c) => c + 1);
  }, []);

  return <Child onClick={handleClick} />;
}
🧪 Behavior:
Without useCallback, handleClick would be a new function on every render, causing Child to re-render.

With useCallback, the same handleClick reference is reused unless dependencies change, so Child only re-renders when necessary.

| Typical Use Case | Math operations, filtering, etc.             | Event handlers passed to child components                 |


🗣️ How to Answer in an Interview
useMemo and useCallback are both used to optimize performance in React.
useMemo is used when we want to avoid re-computing a value unless its dependencies change — it's helpful for expensive calculations.
useCallback is used when we want to avoid re-creating the function reference across renders, especially when passing it to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
While they look similar in syntax, one caches a result, the other caches a function.

🚀 Summary
🧮 Use useMemo for: caching computed values.

🛠️ Use useCallback for: preventing unnecessary function recreation.

🧼 Use both only when needed; unnecessary usage can reduce readability without improving performance.

<!-- Question 21:✅ Why is key important in React while looping? -->

In React, when rendering a list of elements (usually using .map()), assigning a unique key prop to each element is crucial for performance and correctness.

📌 What is a key?
A key is a special string attribute you must include when creating lists of elements in React. It helps React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed.

🔍 Why is it important?
React uses keys to optimize re-rendering. When you update a list:

React compares the current list with the previous list.

With keys, React knows exactly which elements were updated and can efficiently re-render only those.

Without keys, React re-renders everything or worse, may misidentify elements, leading to bugs and incorrect UI behavior.

✅ Example Without key (⚠️ Not Recommended):

const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];

items.map((item) => <li>{item}</li>);
This will cause a warning in React.


✅ Example With key (✅ Recommended):

const items = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];

items.map((item, index) => <li key={index}>{item}</li>);
OR if you have a unique ID:


items.map((item) => <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>);

🚫 Using index as key — be careful!
Using index as a key is okay only if:

The list doesn't change

There is no reordering or removal

Otherwise, use unique IDs whenever possible to avoid rendering issues.

🧠 How to explain in an interview:
"key is important in React because it helps identify elements in a list uniquely. It allows React to track which items changed and re-render them efficiently. Without keys, React may re-render incorrectly or lose component state, especially in dynamic lists."

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 22:📌 What is API Integration in React? -->

API Integration in React means connecting your frontend (React app) with a backend service (like a REST API) to fetch, send, update, or delete data using HTTP requests (typically via fetch() or axios).

🔧 Common Use Cases:
Fetching user data from a server.

Submitting form data to a backend.

Retrieving real-time updates.

Interacting with databases through backend services.

✅ Tools Used for API Calls in React:
fetch() (built-in browser API)

axios (external promise-based HTTP client)

🧠 How to explain API Integration in an Interview:
"API integration in React allows us to connect the frontend to backend services and interact with external or internal data sources. We commonly use fetch or axios to send HTTP requests inside useEffect to ensure data is fetched when the component mounts. Once we receive the response, we update the state using hooks like useState to re-render the UI with the data."

🚀 Pro Tips:
Always handle errors (try...catch or .catch()).

Use async/await for cleaner syntax.

Use loading states to improve UX.

Use useEffect() for side effects like API calls.

Consider custom hooks for reusable fetch logic.

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<!-- Question 22: Difference between fetch and axios -->

✅ 1. What is fetch()?
fetch() is a built-in JavaScript function used to make HTTP requests. It returns a Promise that resolves to the response.


fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

Native browser API.

Requires manual conversion to JSON.

Not supported in older browsers (e.g., IE).


✅ 2. What is axios?
axios is a popular third-party HTTP client library that simplifies HTTP requests and provides many additional features.

import axios from 'axios';

axios.get('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(res => console.log(res.data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

Uses Promises like fetch.

Automatically parses JSON.

Supports request/response interception.

Has better error handling.

| Feature                   | `fetch()`                      | `axios`                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| **Built-in**              | ✅ Yes                          | ❌ No (needs to be installed)       |
| **Default JSON parsing**  | ❌ No (you must call `.json()`) | ✅ Yes                              |
| **Request cancellation**  | ❌ No (manual AbortController)  | ✅ Yes (via built-in support)       |
| **Interceptors**          | ❌ No                           | ✅ Yes (pre/post request handling)  |
| **Timeout support**       | ❌ No                           | ✅ Yes                              |
| **Error Handling**        | Must manually check `res.ok`   | Automatically throws on bad status |
| **Older Browser Support** | ❌ No (needs polyfill)          | ✅ Yes                              |
| **Request Configuration** | Verbose                        | Cleaner, simpler                   |


🧠 Interview Answer Example:
"fetch() is a native JavaScript method for making HTTP requests, but it requires manual handling of things like JSON conversion and HTTP errors. axios is a more feature-rich HTTP client that automatically handles JSON, timeouts, interceptors, and cleaner syntax. For basic requests, fetch is fine, but for complex applications, axios is usually preferred."

🧠 How to Answer in an Interview
“React is a JavaScript library primarily focused on building UI components. It’s lightweight and flexible, allowing developers to choose libraries for state management, routing, etc. Angular, on the other hand, is a full-fledged framework that comes with everything built-in including routing, form handling, HTTP, and dependency injection. React uses one-way data binding and virtual DOM for performance, while Angular uses two-way binding and real DOM. React is easier to get started with, but Angular offers a more opinionated structure for large-scale apps.”

✅ When to Use What
<!-- Use React when: -->
You want flexibility and control over your tech stack.

You’re building lightweight apps or SPAs.

You want faster performance with Virtual DOM.


<!-- Use Angular when: -->

You need a full-stack framework.

Your team is already familiar with TypeScript.

You are working on large, enterprise-scale applications.
